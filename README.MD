# MixSplitR v6.4
### Mix Archival Tool by KJD

MixSplitR helps you organize your digitized vinyl and CD collection. It works with both recorded mixes and individual tracks, intelligently detecting whether your files are mixes or single songs. For mixes, it splits them into individual tracks, then identifies each song using audio fingerprinting, and organizes everything with full metadata and artwork. Use it to split and tag your personal recordings for easy library management.

## X#X#X#X#X# IMPORTANT YOU MUST READ THIS X#X#X#X#X#

**For Personal Use Only**: This tool is designed to help you organize and archive your personal music collection from digitized vinyl, CDs, and recordings you own or have legal access to.

**Technical Requirement**: The songs need to have 2 seconds of silence in between them for the tool to recognize them as separate tracks. Fully mixed DJ performances with seamless transitions will not work properly.

**KEEP YOUR API KEYS PRIVATE**: After first run, a `config.json` file is created containing your ACRCloud credentials. **DO NOT share this file, upload it to public repositories (GitHub, etc.), or post it online.** Anyone with access to your credentials can use your API quota. Keep `config.json` private and secure. If you accidentally expose it, regenerate your API keys in the ACRCloud console immediately. **The `config.json` file must remain in the same folder as the MixSplitR executable** - if you move the program to a new location, move the config file with it.

---

##  Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up ACRCloud Account

ACRCloud provides the music recognition service that identifies your tracks. Here's how to get your API keys:

1. **Create an Account**
   - Go to [https://console.acrcloud.com/signup](https://console.acrcloud.com/signup)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Create a Project**
   - Log in to the [ACRCloud Console](https://console.acrcloud.com)
   - Click **"Create Project"** or **"Audio & Video Recognition"**
   - Choose **"Audio & Video Recognition"** as the project type
   - Give your project a name (e.g., "MixSplitR")
   - Click **Create**

3. **Get Your API Credentials**
   - In your project dashboard, you'll see three important values:
     - **Host** (looks like: `identify-us-west-2.acrcloud.com`)
     - **Access Key** (a long string of letters and numbers)
     - **Access Secret** (another long string)
   - Keep this page open - you'll need these values in Step 3!

4. **Understanding the Free Tier**
   - ACRCloud offers 2,000 free identifications per month
   - This is enough for approximately 30-40 mixes (depending on track count)
   - Perfect for personal use!

### Step 2: Prepare Your Audio Files

1. Place your digitized audio files in the same folder as the MixSplitR executable
   - **Supported Formats**: WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, OGG, AAC, WMA, AIFF, OPUS
   - **Individual tracks**: Any songs under 8 minutes will be automatically recognized as single tracks
   - **Mixes/Recordings**: Longer recordings (8+ minutes) from vinyl, CDs, or other sources will be treated as mixes and split automatically
2. For mixes, make sure there are clear gaps of silence between tracks (at least 2 seconds)
3. For best results, use high-quality source files from your collection

### Step 3: Run MixSplitR

1. **First Run - API Setup**
   - Double-click the MixSplitR executable
   - The program will ask you for your ACRCloud credentials:
     - **Host**: Paste your Host value (e.g., `identify-us-west-2.acrcloud.com`)
     - **Access Key**: Paste your Access Key
     - **Secret Key**: Paste your Access Secret
   - These credentials are saved in `config.json` in the same folder as the executable
   - **IMPORTANT**: Keep this `config.json` file private and in the same folder as MixSplitR.exe - the program needs it to run

2. **Processing Your Files**
   - The program will automatically detect all supported audio files in the folder
   - **RAM Analysis**: The tool analyzes your available memory and creates optimal batches
   - **Batch Processing**: Large collections are split into batches that fit in your RAM
   - For each batch:
     - **Phase 1 - Smart Splitting**: 
       - Files under 8 minutes are recognized as single tracks (no splitting needed - saves time!)
       - Files 8+ minutes are detected as mixes and split into individual tracks
       - Shows spinner animation during splitting
     - **Phase 2 - Identification & Organization**: 
       - Identifies all tracks using audio fingerprinting
       - Organizes tracks with metadata and artwork
       - Shows progress bar
     - Memory is cleared before starting the next batch
   - Wait for completion - this can take several minutes depending on the number of tracks

3. **Find Your Music**
   - All processed tracks will be in the `My_Music_Library` folder
   - Tracks are organized by artist name
   - Each track includes:
     - Full metadata (artist, title, album)
     - Embedded album artwork
     - High-quality FLAC audio
   - Unidentified tracks are labeled as `File#_Track_#_Unidentified.flac`

##  Tips for Best Results

### RAM-Aware Processing
- MixSplitR automatically detects your available RAM and creates optimized batches (requires psutil)
- On startup, you'll see: "📊 Available RAM for processing: X.X GB"
- Files are analyzed and grouped so each batch fits comfortably in memory
- Large collections (200GB+) are automatically split into multiple batches
- Memory is cleared between batches to prevent crashes
- The tool uses about 70% of available RAM, leaving room for your OS
- Example: On a 16GB system, it might process 5-8 files per batch
- **Fallback Mode**: If psutil is unavailable, files are processed one at a time for maximum safety
- No manual configuration needed - it adapts to your hardware automatically!

### Smart Processing
- You can process both individual tracks AND mixes in the same batch
- Files under 8 minutes are instantly recognized as single tracks (no splitting)
- Files 8+ minutes are automatically detected as mixes and split accordingly
- Mix individual songs with mixes in the same folder for efficient batch processing
- All supported formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, OGG, AAC, WMA, AIFF, OPUS) can be processed together

### Audio Quality
- Use high-quality source files (320kbps MP3 minimum, or lossless formats)
- Avoid heavily compressed or low-quality recordings
- Ensure clean recordings without excessive noise
- Lossless formats (WAV, FLAC, AIFF) provide the best results

### Track Separation
- Make sure there are clear gaps between tracks (at least 2 seconds of silence)
- The tool uses `-40dB` threshold for silence detection
- If tracks aren't splitting correctly, your mix may have no silence between tracks

### Identification Success
- Popular mainstream tracks are more likely to be identified
- Very obscure, unreleased, or heavily edited tracks may not be recognized
- Live recordings or mashups are harder to identify
- Low-quality recordings reduce identification accuracy

### API Limits
- Free tier: 2,000 identifications/month
- Each track in your mix uses one identification
- Monitor your usage in the ACRCloud console
- Consider upgrading if you process many mixes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No audio files found"
- Make sure your audio files are in a supported format: WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, OGG, AAC, WMA, AIFF, or OPUS
- Place them in the same folder as MixSplitR.exe
- Check that files aren't corrupted

### Program asks for API credentials again
- The `config.json` file may be missing from the program folder
- Make sure `config.json` is in the same folder as MixSplitR.exe
- If you moved the program, move the `config.json` file too
- If the file was deleted, you'll need to re-enter your credentials (they'll be saved again)

### "Note: psutil not found - will process files one at a time"
- This is a safety fallback when the psutil library isn't available
- Files will be processed individually to prevent memory issues
- This is slower but completely safe
- To enable faster batch processing, install psutil: `pip install psutil` (for Python users)
- Executable releases should include psutil automatically

### "API Error" or "Recognition Failed"
- Check your ACRCloud credentials in `config.json`
- Verify you haven't exceeded your monthly quota
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the audio quality is sufficient

### Tracks Not Splitting
- Your mix may have no silence between tracks
- Try using audio editing software to add brief gaps between songs
- Consider adjusting the silence detection threshold (requires editing the Python source)

### Wrong Song Identified
- This can happen with similar-sounding tracks or poor audio quality
- You can manually rename/retag the file after processing
- Higher quality source audio improves accuracy

### Program Won't Start (Windows)
- Windows may block the executable - right-click → Properties → Unblock
- Make sure you have the latest Windows updates
- Try running as administrator

##  Building from Source (For Developers)

If you're building the executable yourself using PyInstaller:

1. **Install all dependencies first:**
   ```bash
   pip install pydub mutagen acrcloud requests tqdm psutil
   ```

2. **Build the executable:**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name MixSplitR MixSplitacr.py
   ```

3. **Include ffmpeg/ffprobe** in the same directory as the executable for audio processing

**Note**: Make sure psutil is installed before building to enable RAM-aware batch processing. Without it, the program will fall back to one-file-at-a-time processing.
